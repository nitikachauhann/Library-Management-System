# Library-Management-System

This is a simple Library Management System built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and MySQL.
It allows librarians to manage books and student records easily. 
The system includes features like adding books, issuing and returning books, tracking available copies, and calculating fines for late returns.
The backend handles data storage using MySQL, and the frontend provides a basic interface for performing library operations.
